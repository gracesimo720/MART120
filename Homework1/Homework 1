the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the Command-Line Interface (CLI). A GUI is the one most people see every day. It has windows, icons, buttons, and menus that you click on. GUIs are easy to use and don’t require much technical knowledge. They are great for things like browsing the internet, writing papers, or editing photos.

The CLI is very different. Instead of clicking, you type commands into a terminal. At first, it can be confusing because you need to know the exact commands. But once you learn it, the CLI can be faster and more powerful. It’s used for automating tasks, fixing problems, or controlling systems without a GUI.

Both GUIs and CLIs are useful in different ways. GUIs are easier to learn and more visual, while CLIs give more control and speed. Learning about both helped me understand why people use them for different purposes and how each one is important.
