  <h1>My Favorite Story: Coraline</h1>

  <p>
    One of my favorite stories is <em>Coraline</em> by Neil Gaiman. It follows a young girl who
    discovers a hidden door in her new home that leads to a mirror version of her world. At first,
    everything seems perfect — her “Other Mother” is kind and attentive — but soon Coraline learns
    that this world is a trap. With courage and cleverness, she must rescue her parents and herself
    from being trapped forever.
